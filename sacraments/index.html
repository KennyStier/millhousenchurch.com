        <h1>The Seven Sacraments</h1>

        <p>A sacrament is said to be, "a visible sign of God's invisible grace".</p>
        <blockquote>The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions. - <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c1a2.htm">Catechism of the Catholic Church 1131</a></blockquote>
        <p>The seven sacraments include Baptism, Penance, the Eucharist, Confirmation, the Annointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony.</p>
        <blockquote>Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life; they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life. - <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2.htm">Catechism of the Catholic Church 1210</a></blockquote>
